# TelForceOne-Fast-Search-Bar

## Description
TFOFastSearchBar is a UserScript designed to enhance the search functionality on the website https://sklep.telforceone.pl/pl-pl/. The script provides additional features and improves the user experience by removing unnecessary elements and adding event listeners to the search elements.

## Features
- Removes the "search--open" class from the search elements when they are clicked.
- Listens for changes in the class attribute of the `<body>` element and removes the "bluSea" class if it is added.

2. Copy the entire script code from the repository.

The UserScript will automatically run on the designated website (https://sklep.telforceone.pl/pl-pl/) and provide the enhanced search functionality.
